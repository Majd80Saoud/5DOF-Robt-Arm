# 5DOF-Robt-Arm

## 🧠 Project Description:
This is a simple mechanical design of a 5 Degrees of Freedom (5 DOF) robotic arm created using TinkerCAD 3D Design. The model is fully mechanical and does not use Arduino or electronics. It's intended for educational and conceptual purposes.

## 🛠️ Design Tools:

- TinkerCAD 3D Editor
- Basic shapes used:
  - Cylinder
  - Box
  - Torus
  - Round Roof

## 🎨 Customization Tips:

- If the entire model changes color when you only want to change one part:
  1. Select the object and click Ungroup.
  2. Select the specific part (e.g. the base).
  3. Go to the right panel: Solid > Color to change its color.
  4. Regroup all parts if needed.
- For multiple colors in a grouped model, enable "Multicolor".
